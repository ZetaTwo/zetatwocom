Back in February this year, I gave a [lecture at the SecuriTea meetup](https://foocafe.org/malmoe/events/2155-an-introduction-to-binary-exploitation) hosted by [Foo Café](https://foocafe.org/malmoe) in Malmö.
I talked about the basics of binary exploitation. This lecture was heavily based on [the presentation I gave at KTH a few months ago](https://zeta-two.com/education/2019/01/03/google18-talk.html) but a bit shortened and adapted to be slightly more beginner friendly.
The talk was not recorded but you can [download the slides here](/assets/other/foocafe-exploit-slides.pdf).
