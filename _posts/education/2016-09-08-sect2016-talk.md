Today at around 16:00 I'm doing a lightning talk at the [SEC-T security conference](https://www.sec-t.org/) titled "SMT in reverse engineering, for dummies".
A stream to the talk should be available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVxGpXMgPU) where you hopefully will be able to see the talk.
It will probably also be available online afterwards. I will update this post with a link.

In the talk I'm referring to [some scripts I have written](/assets/other/smt-code.zip). You can also download [the slides as a PDF](/assets/other/smt-slides.pdf).
