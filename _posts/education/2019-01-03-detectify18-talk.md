In December, I gave a presentation at a [Detectify](https://detectify.com/) customer event called "Hacker School".
My talk was titled "From Zero to Zero Day" where I talked about my background and journey into security and a cool remote code execution bug we found in GitHub enterprise.
There was no publicly available recording of the talk but you can [download the slides here](/assets/other/detectify18-slides.pdf).
