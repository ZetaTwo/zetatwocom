In September this fall, I gave a presentation at [NixuCon 2018](https://www.nixu.com/).
My talk was titled "Using SMT solvers for binary analysis and exploitation" where I described the basics of symbolic execution and gave examples on how it can be used in exploitation and reverse engineering.
I have yet to find the recording of the talk but you can [download the slides here](/assets/other/nixucon18-slides.pdf).
Essentially, the talk was a combination of my SEC-T 2016 and 2018 talks with some extra introduction.
In the talk I show some [code examples](/assets/other/smt-code2.zip) which you also can download as a zip.
