Last week, I gave a guest lecture at the [Ethical Hacking course](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/EP272U) at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/).
I talked about the basics of binary exploitation. This lecture was heavily based on [the presentation I gave at Google last year](https://zeta-two.com/education/2019/01/03/google18-talk.html) but with some extra content added.
The [recorded talk is available my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bveH_ocnM) and you can [download the slides here](/assets/other/kth19-exploit-slides.pdf).
