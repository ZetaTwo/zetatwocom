In September this fall, I gave a lightning talk at [SEC-T](https://www.sec-t.org/) 2018.
My talk was titled "Fun with Symbolic Execution" where I described the basics of symbolic execution and gave examples on how it can be used in exploitation and reverse engineering.
The [recorded talk is available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWoqWBBSg64) and you can [download the slides here](/assets/other/sect18-slides.pdf).
In the talk I show some [code examples](/assets/other/smt-code2.zip) which you also can download as a zip.
