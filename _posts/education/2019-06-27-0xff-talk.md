Back in April, I gave a presentation and hosted a workshop on CTF at the [0xFF meetup](https://0xff.se/).
I talked about what CTFs are, why you should play them and how to get started. At the workshop, the participants got to try some basic CTF challenges from various categories.
The [recorded talk is available at the 0xFF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hP-uAbUjl0) and you can [download the slides (from both the talk and the workshop) here](/assets/other/0xff-ctf-slides.pdf).
