On November 19-20 this fall, I presented at PasswordsCon 2018 which was co-hosted at Internetdagarna in Stockholm.
My talk was titled ["Protecting medical data with passwordless authentication"](https://internetdagarna.se/program/passwordscon-day-1/) and I talked a little bit about how we work with authentication and identification at my work, [KRY/LIVI](https://kry.se).
The [recorded talk is available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDtCNtQeaoE) and you can [download the slides here](/assets/other/passwordscon18-slides.pdf).
