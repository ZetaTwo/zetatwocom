Back in February, I gave a presentation at a private meet-up that I run together with some friends where we talk about various technical topics roughly once per month.
I talked about the basics of binary exploitation. This lecture was heavily based on [the presentation I gave at KTH last year](https://zeta-two.com/education/2019/01/03/google18-talk.html) but presented in Swedish this time.
The [recorded talk (in Swedish) is available my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3J7M15d80U) and you can [download the slides here](/assets/other/konsulated-exploit-slides.pdf).
