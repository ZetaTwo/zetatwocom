Earlier this fall at [SEC-T](https://sec-t.org) 2017 I gave a talk about unauthenticated cryptography. The recording of the talk is available online at the [SEC-T YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgvQa7MATFU).

You can also download [the slides as a PDF](/assets/other/sect17-slides.pdf).
