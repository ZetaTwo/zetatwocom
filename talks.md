I have given a few talks at various conferences and other contexts. I have collected them all here for your enjoyment.

* [SEC-T 2016 Talk: SMT in RE](/education/2016/09/08/sect2016-talk.html) - A talk about how SMT can be used in Reverse Engineering originally given at SEC-T 2016.
* [Security Fest 2017 Talk: Reversing with determination](/education/2017/09/21/secfest17-talk.html) - A talk about Reverse Engineering techniques at Security Fest 2017.
* [SEC-T 2017 Talk: Unauthenticated encryption in the wild](/education/2017/10/22/sect2017-talk.html) - A talk about the problems of using unauthenticated encryption given at SEC-T 2017.

* [Krypto i Vardagen - NÃ¤r det blir fel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btLVrlfA1eo) - A talk in Swedish about cryptography attacks as a guest lecturer at Stockholm University. Unfortunately I was very tired when doing this so the delivery is not top notch.
