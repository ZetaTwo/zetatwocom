My name is Calle "Zeta Two" Svensson. I'm a 30 year old graduate in engineering physics with a master's in computer science focused on IT security.
Computers and programming have been a very large part of my life since I was very young.
This site is the fifth incarnation of Zeta-Two.com since the original site I created in 2005 and acts as a blog about IT and other technology topics.

I currently work as a security engineer at Google as part of their internal red team.

As stated above I'm into computer science a lot and is proficient with most mainstream languages with my favorites being Python, Rust and Scala.
I've been into security for real since about 2013 following a very long interest for the subject.
I'm currently competing in [CTF:s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security) together with the team [HackingForSoju](https://ctftime.org/team/3208). 
Aside from computers, I do long distance running which is very good for clearing the head or thinking about difficult problems.
If you want to know more about me, feel free to contact me through any of the methods listed at the bottom of the page.
