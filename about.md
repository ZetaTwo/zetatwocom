My name is Calle "Zeta Two" Svensson. I'm a 30 year old graduate in engineering physics with a master's degree in computer science focused on IT security.
Computers and programming have been a very large part of my life since I was very young.
This site is the fifth incarnation of Zeta-Two.com since the original site I created in 2005 and acts as a blog about IT and other technology topics.

I currently work as a security engineer at Google as part of their internal red team.

As stated above I'm into computer science a lot and is proficient with most mainstream languages with my favorites being Python, Rust and Scala.
Since about 2013 I have focused a lot on IT security, both academically and professionally, following a very long interest for the subject.
I used to compete a lot in [Capture the Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security) competitions, primarily together with the team [HackingForSoju](https://ctftime.org/team/3208) but I have also guest played with some other teams from time to time. I also founded the Scandinavian collaboration team [NorseCode](https://norsecode.team). Recently however, I have spent less time on CTFs as I am trying to focus on other topics. 
Aside from computers, I do long distance running which is very good for clearing the head or thinking about difficult problems.
