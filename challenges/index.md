On this page I plan to publish various challenges I have created. I currently only have one challenge here but I have an ambition to create more over time, especially focused on game hacking.

## Starcraft: Brood War - EUD Pwnable

![Starcraft: Brood War logo](/assets/images/software/broodwar-logo.jpg)

The goal of this challenge is to exploit an old bug in Starcraft: Brood War. It was originally developed for the Midnight Sun 2020 CTF but I have now published it here for anyone to try out. To attempt the challenge, [download the materials](/assets/other/starcraft-challenge.tgz), follow the instructions and start hacking. Once you have solved the challenge, please send me an email as outlined in the README file. If there are any issues with the challenge, reach out to me. Note that there are public write-ups of the challenge but I expect you to not simply copy-paste an existing solution. I will soon also publish a post about building the infrastrucure for this challenge as it was quite a project.
